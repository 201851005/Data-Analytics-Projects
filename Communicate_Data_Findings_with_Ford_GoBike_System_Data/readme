This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area and Boston area.

Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities 
covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.
If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding in analysis from other cities, following links from [this page] or [this page].

Example Topics: 
When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
How long does the average trip take?
Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
