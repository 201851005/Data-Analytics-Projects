## Data set Overview and Notes
### Data source :
Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area .

### Features :
Trip Duration (seconds) , Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude ,  End Station ID , End Station Name,  End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) , Member Year of Birth, Member Gender


## Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities 
covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full year’s coverage is desired.
If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding in analysis from other cities, following links from [this page] or [this page].

## Topics: 
When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
How long does the average trip take?
Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
